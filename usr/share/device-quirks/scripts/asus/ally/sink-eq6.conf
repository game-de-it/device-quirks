# 6 band sink equalizer

# Copy this file into a conf.d/ directory such as
# ~/.config/pipewire/filter-chain.conf.d/
#
### Explanation of setting items
#
## [Freq]
# Frequency to change (Hz).
# (If you set Freq to 0 and increase Gain, it will work like a preamplifier.)
#
## [Q]
# This is the value that determines how many frequencies before and after the frequency set in Freq will be involved and changed.
# The higher the Q value, the less bandwidth will be affected.
# For example, if you set the Q value to 4.3, the bandwidth will be very narrow and it may sound unnatural.
# (By increasing the Q value and lowering the Gain, you can pinpoint a specific frequency and use it as a noise filter.)
# Setting it to a fairly moderate value between 0.6 and 1.0 gives a nice feel.
#
## [Gain]
# Set the amplification value between -10 and 20.
